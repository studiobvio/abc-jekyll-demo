# ABC School Demo

Architecture Beyond Capitalism (ABC) School is an open-source education platform for cooperatively evolving and democratizing tools and techniques that empower communities to imagine and build equitable and sustainable futures through design. The platform provides a space for sharing, testing, and evolving innovative approaches to

- [announcements](announcements.md) for relavent news and events,
- [syllabus](calendar.md) for structured educational content,
- [contributor](staff.md) pages for connecting,
- and a [tool foundry](toolbox.md) for specific opens source technology development.

Just the Class is a template that extends the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme, which provides a robust and thoroughly-tested foundation for your website. Just the Docs include features such as:

- automatic [navigation structure](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/),
- instant, full-text [search](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/search/) and page indexing,
- and a set of [UI components](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/utilities).
